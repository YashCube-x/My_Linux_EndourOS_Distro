# My Linux EndeavourOS Distro — Hyprland Calm-Slate Rice

A complete Hyprland desktop setup: Hyprland (native Lua config) + Waybar (with
Quickshell as an on-demand alternate shell) + Kitty + Wofi + Mako + Neovim +
zsh/Starship, all on one consistent "calm slate" color palette — plus
`hypridle`/`hyprlock`, a wallpaper picker, screenshot annotation, screen
recording, GTK theming, and 80+ keybindings (press `SUPER+H` any time for the
full list).

There are two ways to set this up: **do it yourself step by step**, or
**hand it to an AI CLI (Claude Code / Gemini CLI) and let it do the work**.

---

## Color scheme — "calm slate"

Base/neutral colors (bar background, workspace pills, window title):

| Color | Hex | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| Crust | `#12141d` | Bar/lock-screen background |
| Separator | `#2a2d3a` | Dividers, borders |
| Muted | `#7a8296` | Inactive text, muted labels |
| Slate blue | `#8fb0e8` | Active workspace, Hyprland active border (gradient end) |
| Mauve | `#cba6f7` | Hyprland active border (gradient start) |

Each waybar/wlogout module gets its own accent — background + a dark
foreground (`#0d1f14`–`#241505` range) for contrast:

| Module | Background | Where else it's used |
|---|---|---|
| Launcher / clock | `#c9b8ff` (light purple) | wlogout logout button |
| RAM / disk | `#5ecb8a` (sage green) | — |
| CPU | `#f0a93e` (amber) | wlogout reboot button |
| Brightness | `#f0c65e` (yellow) | — |
| WiFi | `#a48ff0` (purple) | — |
| Bluetooth | `#5edfe8` (cyan) | — |
| Volume | `#7ea6f0` (blue) | wlogout sleep button |
| Battery / power | `#f08a94` (rose) | wlogout shutdown button |

Kitty, wofi, hyprlock, and mako use the standard
[Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) palette rather
than these custom accents — close in spirit (same dark-base philosophy) but
not pixel-matched to the table above. GTK apps (Thunar, blueman-manager,
yad) use `catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha` with a blue accent, applied via
`gsettings` (see Known Limitations below for why they're not pixel-matched
either).

All the exact values live in `config/waybar/style.css` (`@define-color`
block at the top) and `config/hypr/hyprland.lua` (`col.active_border` /
`col.inactive_border` in the `general` section) if you want to retheme
anything.

## Option A: Do it yourself

### Step 1 — Install EndeavourOS

Download the ISO from [endeavouros.com](https://endeavouros.com/), flash it
to a USB drive (`dd`, or [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) on Windows), boot from
it, and go through the installer. Pick any desktop option during install
(or "No Desktop") — this repo replaces whatever it sets up.

*(Using plain Arch instead? Follow the
[Arch install guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide),
then install an AUR helper yourself before Step 3:)*
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay && makepkg -si
```

### Step 2 — Pull this repo

Once you're booted in and logged into a terminal, with internet working:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YashCube-x/My_Linux_EndourOS_Distro.git ~/dotfiles
```

### Step 3 — Run the installer

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

This installs every package the setup needs (via `pacman` and `yay`),
symlinks all the configs into `~/.config/`, enables the required system
services, and applies the GTK theme. Reboot (or log out and back in) once
it finishes.

---

## Option B: Let an AI CLI do it for you

If you have (or are willing to install) **Claude Code** or **Gemini CLI**,
you can skip doing this by hand — install whichever one, open a terminal in
your home directory, run it, and paste the prompt below. It will clone the
repo, read this README, run the installer, and — unlike a plain script —
actually troubleshoot anything that goes wrong (missing packages, `sudo`
password prompts it can't answer itself, a config that doesn't apply
cleanly, etc.) instead of just failing silently.

**Install one of these first:**
- Claude Code: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` (needs Node.js:
  `sudo pacman -S nodejs npm` first if you don't have it), then run `claude`
- Gemini CLI: `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`, then run `gemini`

**Then paste this prompt:**

```
Clone https://github.com/YashCube-x/My_Linux_EndourOS_Distro.git into
~/dotfiles (skip if it's already there), read its README.md for context,
then run ./install.sh to set up this Hyprland desktop environment.

Rules for you to follow while doing this:
- You almost certainly can't run `sudo` interactively yourself (no real
  TTY for password prompts). When a command needs sudo, tell me the exact
  command and ask me to run it in my own terminal, then wait for me to
  confirm before continuing.
- After I say a step is "done", verify it actually happened yourself
  (check the package is installed, check the service is running, etc.)
  rather than just trusting my word — I might be wrong about what
  finished.
- If something errors, don't just retry blindly — read the actual error,
  explain what's wrong in plain terms, and fix the root cause.
- If a step is destructive or affects things outside this setup, ask me
  before doing it.
- Once install.sh finishes, reload/restart the relevant services and
  actually confirm the desktop looks right (e.g. screenshot the bar,
  check hyprctl for config errors) instead of assuming it worked.
- Ask me before installing anything not already listed in this repo's
  install.sh or README.
```

## What's in here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `config/hypr/` | `hyprland.lua` (compositor config, 80+ keybinds, animations, blur, tiling controls), `hyprlock.conf`, `hyprpaper.conf`, `hypridle.conf` (auto lock/dim/suspend), `scripts/` (smart volume/brightness/menu/powermenu wrappers, wallpaper picker, keybind cheat-sheet, battery warning, screen-record toggle), `wallpaper/` (switch with `SUPER+W`) |
| `config/waybar/` | Bar config + calm-slate `style.css` + `scripts/` (volume/brightness sliders via `yad`, WiFi popup via `nmcli`+`wofi`, Bluetooth popup via `bluetoothctl`+`wofi`, clipboard picker via `cliphist`, notification toggle) |
| `config/kitty/` | Terminal config, Catppuccin Mocha colors, JetBrains Mono Nerd Font |
| `config/wofi/` | App launcher styling |
| `config/mako/` | Notification daemon styling |
| `config/quickshell/` | Alternate native shell (QML) — control center, OSD, GPU switcher, clipboard manager. Toggle with `SUPER+SHIFT+Q`. Adapted from [matteogini/dotfiles](https://github.com/matteogini/dotfiles). |
| `config/wlogout/` | Centered 4-option power menu (shutdown/restart/sleep/logout) |
| `config/wob/` | Volume/brightness OSD bar used when Quickshell isn't running |
| `config/swappy/` | Screenshot annotation (crop/draw/copy) — `Print`/`SUPER+Print` |
| `config/nvim/` | Neovim config: `lazy.nvim`, LSP via `mason.nvim`, `nvim-cmp` autocomplete, `nvim-tree`, Catppuccin Mocha theme |
| `config/starship.toml` | Shell prompt |
| `config/mimeapps.list` | `mpv` for video, `imv` for images |
| `zshrc` | `.zshrc` |
| `install.sh` | Installs every package below and symlinks everything into place |

Because configs are **symlinked** by `install.sh`, editing a file under
`~/.config/...` afterward is the same as editing it in
`~/dotfiles/config/...` — commit from either place.

## Known limitations / before reusing on a different machine or username

- Four files hardcode the absolute path `/home/suyash/...`: `config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf` and three `config/quickshell/*.qml` files (`AppLauncher.qml`, `ThemeSwitcher.qml`, `shell.qml`). If you restore this under a **different username**, run this before symlinking:
  ```bash
  grep -rl '/home/suyash' ~/dotfiles/config | xargs sed -i 's#/home/suyash#'"$HOME"'#g'
  ```
- `hyprpaper.conf` targets a specific monitor name (`eDP-1`). On different hardware, check `hyprctl monitors` and adjust.
- Neovim plugins (via `lazy.nvim`) aren't vendored here — they install automatically the first time you launch `nvim` (needs internet).
- Bluetooth requires the `bluetooth` service (handled by `install.sh`); the GPU switcher needs `supergfxd` (also handled) **and** actual hybrid Intel/Nvidia graphics to do anything useful.
- GTK apps (Thunar, blueman-manager, yad, pavucontrol) use Catppuccin Mocha (blue accent) + Papirus-Dark icons + matching cursor, applied via `gsettings`. Not pixel-matched to the custom calm-slate hex palette used in the bar/lock-screen/power-menu, but dark and cohesive rather than the default light GTK theme. Quickshell draws its own UI in QML, so it isn't affected either way.
